## Network Graph of Recipes and Ingredients ##
Create a netowrk graph of recepies people can use to explore
- What core components are the "essence" of a particular type of food?

Presentation: Slides + graph.
Next steps:
- (done) Get access to API
- (in progress) Understand the data. Explore it and put into graph.
-- Gauge how much signal might be in the data.
-- Refine scope. Find out if we can answer cooking skill questions like: What new skills do I need to learn to cook Swedish food?, What makes cuisines similar?, What ingredients would I need to buy to make 1 soup and 2 salads each week for a 6 week period?
- (not started) Building a minimum viable product

Data source: Yummly Api. 
- 1 Million recipes aggregated from multiple sources. 
- 100k+ classifications based on Food Genome & Yummly Algorithms: ingredients, diets, allergies, nutrition, taste, techniques & more. 
- 10 Billion+ Data Points to deliver relevant recipes to user.
