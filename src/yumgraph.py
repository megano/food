## Data exploration ##
Start with the analysis we've done with the IMDb dataset:

find the number of nodes and edges
determine the number of connected components
find the most important nodes (using centrality)
compute the communities
'''

'''
1. Get your dataset in a format that Gephi can read.
2. Open Gephi, create a new project and open the file you just created.

3. In the statistics window, you can find things like the average degree.

4. In the ranking window, you can size the nodes based on their degree.

5. In the partition window, you can color the nodes.

6. Play around with other features on Gephi.
